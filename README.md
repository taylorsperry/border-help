## About the project

BorderHelp is an app that describes an individualâ€™s rights and options when he or she is stopped by a Customs and Border Protection official within 100 miles of the United States border (the Border Zone). The audience is anyone asked to provide information about their immigration status within this zone. 

The page loads with an introduction to CBP and a user can click on 'Your Rights' to see a list of rights; 'What to Do' to see a list of options for a given scenario; 'Help' for resources; and 'Location' to see where they are on the map and how far they are from the border between the US and Mexico. 

For this project I built an API using node and express (with data sourced from the ACLU) and utilized the 'Mexico and US Border' API from Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) and geolocation.
